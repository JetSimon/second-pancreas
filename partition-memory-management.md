# Partition Memory Management

Once multiple programs are allowed in memory, it’s the operating sys- tem’s job to ensure that one program doesn’t access another’s memory space. This is an example of a security mechanism implemented at a low level, generally outside the knowledge of the user. 

A more sophisticated approach is to have more than one application program in memory at the same time, sharing memory space and CPU time. In this case, memory must be divided into more than two partitions. Two strategies can be used to partition memory: fixed partitions and dynamic partitions.
