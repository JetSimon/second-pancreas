Things to Remember
* Displacement is not distance! Displacement is final distance travelled! You could go to New York and back but your displacement would be 0.
* Make sure you do not include unnecessary forces in a free body diagram. Only forces that affect the current system.
* Remember to convert your units if they are not in meters or seconds!

# Physics 1118 Formula Sheet

Velocity:
>ΔV = Δx / Δt

Acceleration:
>a = Δv / Δt

Definition of Acceleration: 
>ΔV = v<sub>0</sub> + a t

The Displacement Curve: 
>x - x<sub>0</sub> = v<sub>0</sub>t + ½ . a . t<sup>2</sup>

Range Formula (to get horizontal distance a projectile can travel):

>Where R is distanced travelled horizontally, v<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup> is initial velocity (total, not x/y components) multiplied by sin2θ all over g. This means to find angle, you need to input g then multiply equation by g. Then plug in initial velocity and square it. Then divide equation by that squared velocity. Then get the inverse sin of that number and divide it by 2 to get the original angle. **IMPORTANT NOTE: THIS CAN ONLY BE USED WHEN Δy = 0**

> To find another angle with the same result, take 90 - angle you got. For example 90-20=60, so 20 and 60 degrees should give teh same result for range.

## Forces

Force:

> F = ma

Weight/Gravitational Force:

>F<sub>g</sub> = mg

The unit for force is Newtons (N) or (kg * m) / s<sup>2</sup>

Static (Needed to Get Moving) Friction:
>f<sub>s(max)</sub> = μ<sub>s</sub>N

Where N is usually weight

Kinematic (Moving) Friction:
>f<sub>k</sub> = μ<sub>k</sub>N

## Centripetal Force

T = period of motion (how long it takes to get to the same spot in the circle).

f (frequency) = how many revolutions per second = 1/T Hz (hertz)

Circumference = c = 2π * Radius

2π / T = Radians per Second = Angular Velocity

ω = angular speed (no magnitude)

ω<sub>z</sub> = constant angular velocity

d (diameter) = 2r

Constant Angular Velocity Finder:
> θ(t)=ω<sub>z</sub> * t+θ<sub>0</sub>
 

Revolutions to Radians:
> 2πrad / rev

Change in angle formula (θ in radians):

> Δθ = Δs / r (Δs = change in arc length = distanced travelled in circle)

How Velocity Acts in Circular Motion:

Linear Velocity Equation for Uniform Circular Motion:
> v = 2πr / T = Circumference / Period

(Magnitude of Centripetal) Acceleration 
> a = v<sup>2</sup> / r

Get Angle at Time (θ in radians):
> θ = (-π/30 * t) + (π/2)

Centripetal (towards the center) Force (not a force):

> F<sub>c</sub> = m(v<sup>2</sup> / r) = rω<sup>2</sup>


Banked (angled) Curve (no friction):
> θ = tan<sup>-1</sup>(v<sup>2</sup> / rg)

**270 is actually (3/4)π**

Force of Gravity:

Kepler's Third Law:

 > T<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> / T<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> = r<sub>1</sub><sup>3</sup> / r<sub>2</sub><sup>3</sup>

 ## Torque

 Perpendicular is best for best torque. 

r = distance from point of force to pivot point

 > τ = r * F * sin(θ)

 > r<sub>arm</sum> = r * sin(θ)

 ## Momentum 

Units: Newtons per second or Kilogram meters per second

Momentum is a vector so it can have angles in problems. You can have a p<sub>x</sub> and p<sub>y</sub>

 > p = mv

> Δp = Δ(mv)

 > F<sub>net</sub> = Δp/Δt

Impulse: 

 > Δp = F<sub>net</sub>Δt

It is always possible to find a larger system where momentum is conserved.

Momentum is conserved in collision if friction/etc is negligible.
