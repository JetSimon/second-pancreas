Things to Remember
* Displacement is not distance! Displacement is final distance travelled! You could go to New York and back but your displacement would be 0.

# Physics 1118 Formula Sheet

Velocity:
>ΔV = Δx / Δt

Acceleration:
>a = Δv / Δt

Definition of Acceleration: 
>ΔV = v<sub>0</sub> + a t

The Displacement Curve: 
>x - x<sub>0</sub> = v<sub>0</sub>t + ½ . a . t<sup>2</sup>
