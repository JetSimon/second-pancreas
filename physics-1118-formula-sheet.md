Things to Remember
* Displacement is not distance! Displacement is final distance travelled! You could go to New York and back but your displacement would be 0.
* Make sure you do not include unnecessary forces in a free body diagram. Only forces that affect the current system.

# Physics 1118 Formula Sheet

Velocity:
>ΔV = Δx / Δt

Acceleration:
>a = Δv / Δt

Definition of Acceleration: 
>ΔV = v<sub>0</sub> + a t

The Displacement Curve: 
>x - x<sub>0</sub> = v<sub>0</sub>t + ½ . a . t<sup>2</sup>

Range Formula (to get horizontal distance a projectile can travel):

>Where R is distanced travelled horizontally, v<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup> is initial velocity (total, not x/y components) multiplied by sin2θ all over g. This means to find angle, you need to input g then multiply equation by g. Then plug in initial velocity and square it. Then divide equation by that squared velocity. Then get the inverse sin of that number and divide it by 2 to get the original angle. **IMPORTANT NOTE: THIS CAN ONLY BE USED WHEN Δy = 0**

> To find another angle with the same result, take 90 - angle you got. For example 90-20=60, so 20 and 60 degrees should give teh same result for range.

Force:

> F = ma

Weight/Gravitational Force:

>F<sub>g</sub> = mg

The unit for force is Newtons (N) or (kg * m) / s<sup>2</sup>

Static (Needed to Get Moving) Friction:
>f<sub>s(max)</sub> = μ<sub>s</sub>N

Where N is usually weight

Kinematic (Moving) Friction:
>f<sub>k</sub> = μ<sub>k</sub>N
