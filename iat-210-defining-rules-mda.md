# Defining Rules

* Rules are the deep structure of a game from which all real-world instances of the game's play are derived
* Some structures are ambiguous as to if they are rules or not. Poker with different names for suites would not be a different game, but it may provide a different aesthetic experience.
* You don't technically "need" cards for poker either. Could use anything with the right markings, distribution, etc.
* Rules != Strategies. Strategies are algorithms for using the rules.
* Rules limit player action
* Rules are explicit and unambiguous
* Rules are shared by all players
* Rules are fixed
* Rules are binding (part of magic circle is rules have authority)
* Rules are repeatable

# MDA

Mechanics -> Dynamics -> Aesthetics

* Games are created by designers and consumed by players
* The process of consumption is relatively unpredictable 
* MDA: Rules -> System -> "Fun", Design Equivalent: Mechanics -> Dynamics -> Aesthetics
*  Mechanics - components of the game, at the level of data rep. and algorithms
*  Dynamics - the run-time behavior of the mechanics acting on player inputs/outputs
*  Aesthetics - The desirable emotional responses evoked in the player when they interact with the game
*  Games are more like artifacts - the content comes from the game's behavior, not the media

## Type of Fun

1. Sensation - sense pleasure
2. Fantasy - make-believe, pretend to live another life
3. Narrative - games as drama
4. Challenge - games as obstacle course
5. Fellowship - social framework
6. Discovery - games as uncharted territory
7. Expression - games as self Discovery
8. Submission - games as a pastime 

Games may have multiple of these types in them.

Dynamic models create Aesthetic models

Dynamic model - a dice roll

Aesthetic model - How people see the game over time, etc

Aesthetic goals - what do you want the game to look/feel like, what is your audience?

Dynamic goals - How complex should AI be? How do your systems work? How do the dynamic goals work with the aesthetic goals?
