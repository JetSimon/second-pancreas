# Arousal Theory

Humans are motivated to engage in behaviors that either increase or decrease arousal levels.

High arousal levels motivate engagement in behaviors that will lower these levels. Ex: when you're really horny you wanna fuck to release the horny.

Low arousal levels motivate activities that can increase arousal, often through curiosity. Ex: You're curious about masturbation so you try and get horny.

[[Yerkes-Dodson law]] - Performance increases with arousal only up to a point, beyond which performance decreases.

This is **not** just sexual arousal.

>According to the arousal theory of motivation, each person has a unique arousal level that is right for them. When our arousal levels drop below these personalized optimal levels, we seek some sort of stimulation to elevate them.

>For example, if our levels drop too low we might seek stimulation by going out to a nightclub with friends. If these levels become too elevated and we become overstimulated, we might be motivated to select a relaxing activity such as going for a walk or taking a nap.
