# Defence Mechanisms of The Ego

* The ego protects itself with tactics that reduce and redirect anxiety by reality distortion (defence mechanisms)
* These mechanisms function indirectly and unconsciously 
* Repression underlies all other defence mechanisms. It is sometimes incomplete and may be manifested as symbols in a dream or slips of the tongue.

## Six Defence Mechanisms

1. **Regression** - retreating to an earlier psychological stage 
2. **Reaction formation** - repressing one feeling by outwardly displaying it's opposite (being sad to trying to act super happy)
3. **Projection** - Disguising one's own threatening impulses by attributing them to others
4. **Rationalization** - Justifying bad things you did to not confront the real reason
5. **Displacement** - Shifting sexual or aggressive impulses towards someone less threatening (child mad at parent so kicks dog)
6. **Denial** - Straight up refusing to believe something is real
