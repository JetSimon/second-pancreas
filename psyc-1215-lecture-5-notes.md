* Conscious - What you aware of
* Preconscious - What did you do in the past?
* Unconscious Mind - What you are not aware of
* Free Association - Prompted by questions such as "what do you think about your father" to see what people associate with those thoughts to try and dig deeper into people's unconscious 
* Ego, superego, id - Structures of personality. Ego - The executive of your mind, "you". Conscious; Superego - The moral branch, the part of your brain that has societies morals and stuff in it; Id - The "savage", the pleasure principle, caveman brain. Needs of id satisfied by the ego
* Pleasure principle - The unconscious desire to satisfy base drives to reproduce, survive, and aggress

ID and Ego are fighting between goals.

## Definitions 

* Personality - An individuals pattern of thinking/acting/etc

## [[Freud]]'s Psychoanalytic Perspective 
* Observed patients whose disorders had no biological explanation
* Concluded their problems reflected unacceptable thoughts and feelings, hidden away in the unconscious mind
* Dream analysis
* Free Association
* Slips of the tongue (Freudian Slip)
* [[Freud's Psychosexual Stages]]

# [[Personality Tests]]

# [[Defence Mechanisms of The Ego]]

## Research does NOT support many of Freud's specific ideas

Modern research challenges:
* Freud's conception of repression
* View of the unconscious as a collection of repressed and unacceptable thoughts, wishes, feelings, memories
* Hard to test his concepts scientifically 

[[Humanistic Theories and Trait Theories]]

Humanistic psychologists sometimes used tests to assess personality but some rejected any sort of test and relied on interviews and conversations.

[[Carl Rogers]] sometimes used questionnaires in which people described their ideal and actual selves, which was later used to judge progress in therapy.
