Using a personsa when designing is playing while pretending to be a generic member of an audience. Then you can use that information to help tailor your game more to that audience, or just gain insight.

Personas are designed with high levels of detail, with a specific age, name, skillset, likes, dislikes.

## Steps of Personsa Creation

1. Identify persona data sources - get information on where you can get information on the type of person you are trying to emulate
2. Set up user categories - A user category is a group of users that share a similar characteristic. For example someone may be a browser, content creator, community interactor on instagram.
3. Collect user data - find out the data from the data sources from step 1
4. Prioritize the skeleton - Make sure your persona represents a large segment of your userbase, otherwise you will be tailoring your game towards a smaller audience. Which could hurt the bottom line.
5. Convert your skeleton to persona foundation documents, with their story, job, details, photo, user class, assumptions, etc
6. Designate a personsa type from: User (direct product user. can be primary of secondary. with secondary meaning they would use less), customer, servered (who is not a user ut could affect the use of the product ex: a boss), negative persona (someone who will definitely have no interaction with the product and should not be considered in design)

Stereotypically games are for boys. These stereotypes still influence how we see gamers today. In reality only 20% of online gamers are teenage boys. Though only 20% of online gamers are female, meaning there is currently a male gender imbalance in that gaming space.

Many people use MMORPGs and other forms of online gaming as a social conduit.
