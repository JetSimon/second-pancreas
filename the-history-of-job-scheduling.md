# The History of Job Scheduling

## 1960s

In the 1960s and 70s when computers were big and slow, operators would manually load jobs into the computers based on how many similar resources they shared. These groups of jobs are called *batches* and this process is called ***batch processing***.

Batch systems could be executed in a multiprogramming environment. In that case, the operator would load multiple jobs from the same batch into memory, and these jobs would compete for the use of the CPU and other shared resources. As the resources became available, the jobs would be scheduled to use the CPU.
