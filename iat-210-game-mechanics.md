Mechanics can be hard to define. As they are sometimes very subconscious.

## 6 Main Categories of Game Mechanics

1. ### Space
   1. the space a game takes place in, 0d, 1d, 2d, 3d
   2. either discrete or continuous (chess vs fps)
   3. have bounded areas which may or may not be connected
   4. Monopoly is really 1d - you can only move one direction around a strip
   5. There can be subspaces, separate from each other joined by a hub
2. ### Objects, Attributes, and States
   1. Objects have attributes which have States
   2. Chess: king has a movement attribute with states [can move, in check, checkmated]
   3. You don't need to tell the player every state. Some states only known by CPU.
   4. If two objects look the same then they should behave the same.
   5. Some players can know about a state that are hidden from other players! What cards you hold are your own.
3. ### Actions
   1. Operative actions: Actions the player can take. Ex: move a piece forward, capture a piece, etc
   2. Resultant actions: Actions that are a result of the games systems interacting with the players. Etc: tricking an opponent into making a bad move, building a defence in chess. More "big picture"
   3. How to add more emergence to a game:
      1. Add more verbs (add more operative actions)
      2. Make operative actions be able to act on lots of objects (ex: Rogue)
      3. Multiple ways to achieve a goal
      4. Many subjects - different types of pieces to control
      5. Side effects that change constraints
4. ### Rules
   1. Operational Rules - what the players DO to play the game. When they understand this, they may play the game. Barrier to entry.
   2. Foundational Rules - The underlying formal structure. NOT "player should roll 6 sided die and collect X power chips" YES "players power value is increased by a random number from 1-6". Foundational rules inform operational rules.
   3. Behavioral Rules - How to act when you play the game, good sportsmanship
   4. Written Rules - the rules that come with the game, the rules you read to learn the game. Most people may not ever read these.
   5. Laws - the rules in a competitive setting. Ex: you may bring your own controller, ONLY play with 60 second timer, etc
   6. Official Rules - A mix of written rules with Laws, only when the game is played seriously enough. Over time official rules may become written rules.
   7. Advisory Rules - rules of strategy, the best strat to win, not real rules 
   8. House Rules - Rules that players make up to suit their social circle/style of play/"fix" game, "at my house we roll twice when we land on chance".
   9. There can be different modes in a game that change rules.
   10. The enforcer of a game varies from game to game. A ref, a computer, etc.
   11. The most important rule is the goal of the game. How do you win? This must be clear. (Concrete, Achievable, Rewarding)
5.  ### Skill
    1.  Physical Skills - skills done by physical action, kicking a ball, moving a piece, Etc
    2.  Mental Skills - Coming up with a plan, who knows more trivia, Etc
    3.  Social Skills - Fooling people, collaboration, leadership, etc. Poker is a social game because of lying.
    4.  Real skills vs virtual skills. Your CHARACTER may be good at woodchopping but YOU are not. Unless the controller is an axe or something.
6. ### Chance
   1. Expected value - the average amount a player will get out of an operation of chance
   2. Chance and skill can get mixed up
   3. Estimating chance is a Skill
   4. Skills have a probability of success
   5. You need to be able to estimate the chances of someone doing something, etc
