# iat-210-the-magic-circle

The magic circle is the moment you cross the threshold from the normal world to the game world. You are confident that no harm can come.

This barrier can be fuzzy, as with paida, or more formal, as with ludus.

Games as closed/open depending on the lens:

* Rules - closed system
* Play - closer or open system
* Culture - open system

Lusory Attitude - the player has "bought into" the game. 

There can be more satisfaction in ineffeciency. Seeing a bullet slowly make its way to an enemy as long as its not unfair is satisfying.
