# Intelligence

What is [[intelligence]]?

The most widely used intelligence test is the WAIS.

## Types of intelligence
* Spearman's general intelligence (g) *OUTDATED*
  * Humans have one general intelligence that is at the heart of everything a person does.
  * Mental abilities are like physical abilities.
  * Intelligence involves distinct abilities, which correlate enough to define a small general intelligence factor.
  * Gardner and Sternberg discount this theory and propose several different kinds of intelligence!

* [[Gardner's Multiple Intelligences]]
* [[Sternberg's Three Intelligences]]

## Gardner and Sternberg

### Differences
* Gardner identifies eight independent intelligences and views these as differentiated multiple abilities
* Sternberg agrees with the concept, but proposes only three intelligences.

### Agreement
* Multiple abilities contribute to life success
* Different varieties of giftedness provide educational challenges for education

## Criticism of Multiple Intelligences Theories

* Factor analysis confirms the existence of general intelligence, which predicts performance on a variety of complex tasks
* Success is more than high intelligence; highly successful people are also conscientious, well connected, and energetic
* Researchers report a 10-year rule: Expert performers spend about a decade in intense, daily practice

## Smart and Rich?

Intelligence shows a moderate positive correlation (+30) with their later income. Not super strong but it does have an effect.

## Assessing Intelligence 

### Types of Tests

* Intelligence test - To assess mental aptitude and compare with other scores
* Aptitude test - Designed to predict a person's future performance; **aptitude is the capacity to learn**
* Achievement test - Designed to assess what a person has learned (think exam)

# History of Tests of Mental Ability

## Francis Galton 
* Attempted to assess intelligence (1884)
* Found no correlation between measures
* Provided statistical intelligence
* Believed in the inheritance of genius (wrote a book called Hereditary Genius)

## Alfred Binet

* Tended toward environmental explanation of intelligence differences
* Assumed all children follow the same course, but not rate, of intellectual development
* Measured each child's "mental age"
* Tested a variety of reasoning and problem solving question that predicted how well French children would do in school

## Lewis Terman

* Revised Binet's test for wider use in the USA
* Extended the upper end of the test's range
* Revision was called the Stanford-Binet
* Theorized intelligence tests reveal intelligence with which person with born
* IQ = (mental age of 10 / chronological age of 8) * 100 = 125

## David Wechsler (WAIS)

* Created most widely used intelligence test today
* Yields an overall intelligence score and seperate scores for verbal comprehension, perceptual organization, working memory, and processing speed
* Available in preschool and school age child version
* Provides clues to strengths or weaknesses

## A Good Test Is...

1. Standardized
2. Reliable
3. Valid

# Terms

* Standardization: Defining uniform testing procedures and making sure score comparison is meaningful. Making sure the test works the same no matter what.
* Reliability - Making sure how consistent the test is on the same person
* Validity - Does the test actually work?
* Content Validity - Is the test testing what we want?
* Predictive Validity - Is the test predicting the behavior is is designed to predict? Assessed by computing the validity.

## Is Intelligence Stable?

No it tends to decline over time as we age.

> **Crystallized Intelligence** - Accumulated knowledge, as reflected in vocabulary and word power test. Increases as we age into middle age


> **Fluid Intelligence** - Ability to reason speedily and abstractly, as when solving unfamiliar logic problems. Declines with age, gradually until 75 then rapidly until 85.
