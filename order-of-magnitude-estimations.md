# Order of Magnitude Estimations

One order of magnitude is within factors of 10. So 10 and 12 are the same order of magnitude, but 10 and 120 are not.

The tilde (~) is ued to show that things are in the same order of magnitude, but not exactly equal.

We can make order of magnitude estimations to make calculations in our head easier, and get a ballpark estimate for where the solution to a problem may lay.

Another example is simply approximating the shapes of objects and sizes to get a rough answer. This helps us tell if our more detailed answer looks right just on glance.

## Strategies

1. Do not guess more than one sig fig of precision. (Keep it something like 1 x 10^x)
2. Do not try to guess area, volume, or mass directly. Humans are bad at this. Guess dimensions and get area, volume, or mass based on this. For example animals are mostly water, so you could just get the mass of water in a certain dimension.
3. Dumb down the shapes of objects to make math easier.
4. Use your head. Check your final answer to see if it makes sense, we are pretty good at this. Just think about it like it were real life.
