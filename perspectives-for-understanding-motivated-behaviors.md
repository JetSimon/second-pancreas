# Perspectives for Understanding Motivated Behaviors

* Darwin (Instinct Theory) - Classification of many behaviors as instincts; named but did not explain behaviors.
  * [[Instinct]] - A fixed unlearned pattern throughout a species. Genes predispose some species-typical behavior. For example bird migration.

* [[Drive-reduction theory]]
  * Response to inner pushes, ex: being thirsty is an inner push to resolve thirst

* [[Arousal theory]]
  * Motivated by our need to reach a level of arousal. 

* [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs]]: Priority of some needs over others
