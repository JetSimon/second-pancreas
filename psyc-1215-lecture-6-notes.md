# Social Psychology

A subfield of psychology that studies humans as social animals who interact in groups. How the group impacts the individual.

How we think about, influence, and relate to one another.

## Social Psychologists 

* Use scientific methods to study how people think about influence relate
* Study the social influences that explain behavioral changes in different situations.

# Definitions 

## Fundamental Attribution Error
* The tendency for observers, when analyzing others' behavior, to underestimate the impact of the situation and to overestimate how the persons' mood impacts the situation
* Is most likely to occur when strangers act badly
* Has real-life and social consequences 
* When you see a homeless person on the street, do you blame them or do you blame society? Most people blame them.

### Napolitan and colleagues (1979)

* Students attributed the behavior of others to personal traits even when they were told that behavior was part of an experimental situation.

## Attitudes 

* Feelings influenced by beliefs, which predispose people to have specific reactions to objects, people, and events

* **Peripheral Route Persuasion** - When someone is influenced by incidental cues, such as attraction to the speaker
* **Central Route Persuasion** - When interested people focus on the arguments and respond with favorable thoughts.

### Actions can Modify Attitudes 
* Foot in the door Phenomenon - The tendency for people who have agreed to a small request to later comply with a larger request
* Role - A set of expectations (norms) about a social position - how to behave as an x
* Attitudes Follow Behavior - Cooperative actions, such as those performed by people on sports teams, feed mutual liking. Such attitudes in turn promote positive behavior. You like people on your team!

### Cognitive Dissonance 

* When attitudes do not fit with actions, tensions are often reduced by changing attitudes to match actions.
*  We act to reduce the discomfort we feel when our thoughts clash. 
*  Brain regions become more action. 
*  Through cog. dis. we often bring attitudes into line with our own actions.

## Social Contagion 

* Chartrand and colleagues (1999) demonstrated the **chameleon effect** with college students.
* Automatic mimicry helps people empathize with others.
* The more we mimic the greater the empathy and the more people tend to like us 
* This is a form of conformity

### People Most Likely To Conform
* Feel incompetent or insecure
* Their group has at least 3 people
* Everyone else agrees
* They admire the groups status and attractiveness 
* They have not yet committed to another response 
* They know they are being observed
* Their culture encourages respect for social standards.

### Stanley Milgram's Experiments 
* People obeyed orders even when they thought they were harming another person.
* Strong social influences can make ordinary people conform to falsehoods or exhibit cruel behavior
* In any society, great evil acts often grow out of people's compliance to lesser evils (foot in door)
* The experiment with shocking the guy.

# Group Behavior

* Social Facilitation (Triplett): The presence of others arouses people, improving performance on easy or well-learned tasks but decreasing performance on difficult tasks.
  * Performance can also be hindered because the most likely but not the correct response occurs.
    * Hometown Advantage
    * Crowding effect

* Social Loafing - Tendency for people in a group to work less when in a group 
  * Because acting in a group feels less accountable
  * Feel like you aren't making a difference
  * Taking advantage when there is lack of identification in a group

* Deindividuation - A loss of self-awareness and self-restraint that occurs in group situations that foster arousal and anonymity. Thrives in many different settings.

## Group Polarization and Groupthink
* Group polarization - Group discussions with like minded others strengthen members beliefs/attitudes.
  * Internet communication magnifies this effect.
* Groupthink - People are driven by a desire for harmony within decision making group. With this desire overriding realistic appraisal of alternatives.
* Individual Power - The power of the individual and the power of the situation interact. A small minority that consistently expresses its views may sway the majority.
