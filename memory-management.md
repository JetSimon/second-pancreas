# Memory Management

## *Terms*

* *Base Register* - A register that holds the beginning address of the current partition
* *Bounds Register* - A register that holds the length of the current partition

## Overview

All programs are stored in main memory when they are executed. All data referenced by those programs are also stored in main memory so that they can be accessed. Main memory can be thought of as a big, continuous chunk of space **divided into groups of 8, 16, or 32 bits**. Each byte or word of memory has a corresponding address, which is simply an integer that uniquely identifies that particular part of memory. **The first memory address is 0.**

*A program is filled with references to variables and to other parts of the program code. When the program is compiled, these references are changed into the addresses in memory where the data and code reside. But given that we don’t know exactly where a program will be loaded into main memory, how can we know which address to use for anything?*

The solution is to use two kinds of addresses: logical addresses and physical addresses. A logical address (sometimes called a virtual or relative address) is a value that specifies a generic location relative to the program but not to the reality of main memory. A physical address is an actual address in the main memory device.

The mapping of a logical address to a physi- cal address is called address binding.

## Types of Memory Management

* [[single-contiguous-memory-management]]
* [[partition-memory-management]]
* [[paged-memory-management]]

Address binding is basically the same for both fixed and dynamic partitions. As with the single contiguous memory management approach, a logical address is an integer relative to a starting point of 0.

Which partition should we allocate to a new program? There are three general approaches to partition selection:
 * First fit, in which the program is allocated to the first partition big enough to hold it
 * Best fit, in which the program is allocated to the smallest partition big enough to hold it
 * Worst fit, in which the program is allocated to the largest partition big enough to hold it


It doesn’t make sense to use worst fit in fixed partitions because it would waste the larger partitions. First fit and best fit both work for fixed partitions. In dynamic partitions, however, worst fit often works best because it leaves the largest possible empty partition, which may accom- modate another program later on.
