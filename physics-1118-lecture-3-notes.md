# Physics 1118 Lecture 3 Notes

## Definitions of Common Vectors

* Position - The location in space an object is in. In one dimension it will only be one direction (ex: a car is 10 meters head of you), in two dimensions it will have both an X and Y axis (like on a graph), in three dimensions it will have X Y Z.
* Velocity - The amount a position changes in a certain period of time
* Acceleration - The amount a velocity changes in a certain period of time. Velocity is to position as acceleration is to velocity.
* Displacement - The final position of an object compared to a starting position. If you walked to the store and back your displacement would be zero, although you did move.

## Tips to Solving Problems

1. Write out what you know, make a diagram, label it!
2. Keep a list of formulas. If you don't have one [you can use mine](physics-1118-formula-sheet.md)!
3. Think about which formulas have most of the variables you already know. Ideally you want to be able to just solve for one variable.
4. Write what you are trying to solve for on the page so you don't forget! If you organize all the pieces it is easier to solve a puzzle.
5. Be sure to write down units at every step to avoid mistakes.
6. Do not write gravity as -9.81 m/s<sup>2<sup>. The negative will probably mess you up.
