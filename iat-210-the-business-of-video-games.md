## 4 P's of Marketing
    * Product: How does it serve an audience?
    * Place: Where will you sell it?
    * Price: How much does it cost?
    * Promotion: What communication strategies are being used? Sometimes this can be more story focused than gameplay focused as in trailers.

    Example: Undertale
    * Product: Nostalgic game that revolves around RPG rules while challenging conventions
    * Place: Steam/GoG
    * Price: $20 (standard indie price)
    * Promotion: Kickstarter, Website, Reviews, Sales


Games usually have two types of video ads: Cinematic trailers (more like movies trailers, story, etc), and Gameplay trailers (often indie gmaes only have this type of trailer)

## Advertising in Games

* Static Advertising: basically product placement in a game. Advertising that is programemd into the code specifically for a product/company
* Dynamic Advertising: Advertising that changes over time, companies pay per click, in game ads.
