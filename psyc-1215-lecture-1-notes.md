## Research Methods and Statistics

Statements of probability - Inferential Statistics (you can infer the likelihood of something happening to someone in a group where you have the statistics)

[[Scientific Method]] - Observation > Theory > Hypothesis > Research and Observation > Confirm, Reject, or Revise and start again!

***

**A Good Theory**

* Effectively organizes
* Leads to clear predictions
* Often stimulates research
* May be replicated


***

**Testing hypothesis and refining theories**

* Description - Not changing anything, just taking notes, surveys, etc.
* Correlation - See [[Correlation]]
* Causation 
* Experiments - Cause and effect research being conducted (dependant and independent variable [see: [[experiment-variables]]]. ex: independent is drug; dependant is disease)


***

Case Study - The examination of an individual in depth, provides fruitful ideas but cannot be used to generalize conclusions!

***

Naturalistic Observation - Records behavior in natural environment. Describes but does not explain behavior, but can be revealing.

***

Correlation and Causation - No matter how strong the relationship is, **Correlation does not prove Causation!!!***. For example just because a city has more fire trucks and also has more fires does not mean fire trucks cause fires!

Correlation Coefficient - Provides a statistical measure of how closely two things vary together and how well one predicts the other. (from: [[correlation]])

***

### Research Strategies: Regression Toward the Mean

* Illusory correlation - The perception of a relationship between two variables when only a minor or no relationship actually exists. May be fed by regression toward the mean. Kind of like superstitious behaviors. Like a lucky coin that always helps you win.
* Regression toward the mean - The tendency for extreme or unusual scores or events to fall back (or regress) towards the average. People don't suddenly get super powers, it can just be coincidence. 

***

## Experimentation 

* Double-blind Procedure - Eliminates bias. Neither those in the study nor the researchers know which group receives treatment. Treatment's actual effects can be separated from potential placebo effect.
* Placebo Effect - Effect involves results caused by expectations alone.

Random assignment can control for confounding variables in studies.

## Descriptive Statistics 

Mathematical methods used to organize and summarize, or *describe* data. Like a graph. Useful for putting information about a distribution into a more compact form, summarizing the distribution with a single score that is typical in some way.

---

[[Measures of Central Tendency]] - A single number that presents information about the "center" of a frequency distribution.

## Measures of Variability

[[Standard Deviation]]

Range - the highest score minus lowest score, a simple measure of variability.

---

The Normal Curve - The shape that usually appears on aptitude tests. AKA Bell Curve. Where average is a big hill.

# Inferential Statistics 

Mathematical methods used to draw conclusions about a population based on a sample of data. Randomized population to be fair.

In psychology it is used to determine if the likelihood of an outcome in a study is just due to chance, or due to a real difference.

Inferential Errors
* **Type I error**: Erroneously concluding that study results are significant - ex: that a polygraphs test indicate a lie, when in fact polygraphs are very inaccurate!
* **Type II error**: Failing to find a significant effect that does, in fact, exist! - Ex: A lie detector says someone is telling the truth when they actually are lying.
