## Research Methods and Statistics

Statements of probability - Inferential Statistics (you can infer the likelihood of something happening to someone in a group where you have the statistics)

[[Scientific Method]] - Observation > Theory > Hypothesis > Research and Observation > Confirm, Reject, or Revise and start again!
***
**A Good Theory**

* Effectively organizes
* Leads to clear predictions
* Often stimulates research
* May be replicated
***
**Testing hypothesis and refining theories**

* Description - Not changing anything, just taking notes, surveys, etc.
* Correlation 
* Causation 
* Experiments - Cause and effect research being conducted (dependant and independent variable [see: [[experiment-variables]]]. ex: independent is drug; dependant is disease)
***
Case Study - The examination of an individual in depth, provides fruitful ideas but cannot be used to generalize conclusions!
***
Naturalistic Observation - Records behavior in natural environment. Describes but does not explain behavior, but can be revealing.
***
Correlation and Causation - No matter how strong the relationship is, **Correlation does not prove Causation!!!***. For example just because a city has more fire trucks and also has more fires does not mean fire trucks cause fires!

Correlation Coefficient -

### Research Strategies: Regression Toward the Mean

* Illusory correlation - The perception of a relationship between two variables when only a minor or no relationship actually exists. May be fed by regression toward the mean. Kind of like superstitious behaviors. Like a lucky coin that always helps you win.
* Regression toward the mean - The tendency for extreme or unusual scores or events to fall back (or regress) towards the average. People don't suddenly get super powers, it can just be coincidence. 

***

## Experimentation 

* Double-blind Procedure - Eliminates bias. Neither those in the study nor the researchers know which group receives treatment. Treatment's actual effects can be separated from potential placebo effect.
* Placebo Effect - Effect involves results caused by expectations alone.

Random assignment can control for confounding variables in studies.
