Casual games are NOT hardcore blood fx, realism. Audience 50% women and 80% over 30 years old.

Puzzle designer Scott Kim says in 1998: "The point is that people play different types of games for different reasons. Expert gamers play for the longer term rewards of competition and rankings, whereas casual gamers play for the shorter-term rewards of beauty and distraction."

"Games for the rest of us"

Early casual game examples include Myst, Monopoly, Lego Island

But some could say Pac-Man, Tetris, Solitaire for Windows. Due to the game crossing traditional gamer boundaries (gender, age, etc).

2001 Bejeweled sometimes called "the genesis of the casual gaming boom"

Stereotypically, hardcore gamers tend to like games with story, want to have high game knowledge, invest large amounts of time, and love a good challenge. While casual gamers are the opposite. Tending to prefer games with a light story (easily get into), want simple to understand mechanics, to invest a small amount of time (perhaps on the bus), and want to submit to a game vs be challenged by it.

Though these are stereotypes and plenty of players on both ends fall more into the other.

For example a casual player may spend all night grinding at their casual game. Because it matters to them and was easy to get into.

Fiction in casual games and hardcore games differ in a majority of casual games, you will be able to understand the story and "universe" of the game fairly quickly. Positive and familiar settings.

Casual games usually have greater **usability**. Swiping on a touch screen is more intuitive than memorizing traditional controller layouts. Wii remotes are the ultimate casual console controller because of how physical they are.

Interfaces (controllers, ways player can interact) are *interaction instruments* that mediate between the user and the *domain objects* the player wants to act on.

How well a controller works with the action it is simulating is its 'degree of compatibility'

A good interface has:

* Continuous representation of the object of interest
* Physical actions or labeled button presses instead of complex syntax
* Rapid, incremental, reversible operations whose impact on the objet of interest is immediately viable
* Layered or spiral approach to learning that permits usage with minimal knowledge.

Casual games must be interruptive. You should be able to pick them up and put them down as the outside world demands. Informed knowledge of game session length.

Casual games must have a reasonable difficulty curve. Easy to learn, difficult to master. They can be "hard" as long as they follow these guidelines. Too easy and players will be bored.

Casual games are juicy! Lots of positive feedback for actions. Sparkles, sounds, fx. The players will be praised. 

To sum up, casual games are:

1. Light fiction
2. Usable
3. Interruptive 
4. Reasonable difficulty, low stakes punishment
5. Juicy

Hardcore gamers can become casual due to life experiences.
