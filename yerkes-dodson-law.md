# Yerkes-Dodson Law

The theory that performance increases with arousal only up to a point, beyond which performance decreases.

Example: Being challenged to do as many push ups as you can would be easier if you are already "aroused" from playing a sports game. But if you were over aroused cause you're tired, then it won't help.

Also known as the inverted U hypothesis.
