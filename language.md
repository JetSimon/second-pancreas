# Language

Involves our spoken, written, or signed words and the ways we combine them to communicate meaning.

It is used to transmit civilization's knowledge from one generation to the next and connects humans.

## Three Building Blocks of Spoken Language

* [[Phoneme]] - Smallest distinctive sound unit in language.
* [[Morpheme]] - Smallest language unit that carries meaning.
* [[Grammar]] - The system of rules that enables humans to communicate with one another.
  * [[Semantics]] - Deriving meaning from sound
  * [[Syntax]] - Ordering words into sentences.
