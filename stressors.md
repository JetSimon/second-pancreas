# Stressors

Specific events or chronic pressure that place demands on a person or threaten their well being

There are long term or [[chronic-stressors]] and short term acute stressors

Stressors challenge you to do something about them. Having lack of control over a situation can add to stress. Studies show perceived control can be related to more effective coping. A lack or perceived control underlies other stressors.
