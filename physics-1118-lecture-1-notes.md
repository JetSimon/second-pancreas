[[Order of Magnitude Estimations]]

~ = on the order of, magnitude, approximation

∝ = is proportional to (ex: Area scales as the second power of length, A ∝ L2, while
volume scales as length to the third power, V ∝ L3)

Using these order of magnitude estimation techniques we can get rough answers to problems. These rough problems are called back of envelope problems, or [[Fermi Problems]]. Named after a famous physics guy.
