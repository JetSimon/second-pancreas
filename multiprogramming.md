# multiprogramming

*Multiprogramming* - The technique of keeping multiple programs in main memory at the same time. 

This is used in ***timesharing*** to allow multiple users to use one computer at the same time.

Originally, timesharing systems consisted of a single computer, often called the mainframe, and a set of dumb terminals connected to the main- frame. A dumb terminal is essentially just a monitor display and a key- board. A user sits at a terminal and “logs in” to the mainframe. The dumb terminals might be spread throughout a building, with the mainframe residing in its own dedicated room. The operating system resides on the mainframe, and all processing occurs there.
