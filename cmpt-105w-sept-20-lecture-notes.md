## Developing a Credible Argument

* Simple claims -> complex Argument

Invention:
- Discovery
- Putting ideas into Words
- Starting writing

Credible - reliable, trustworthy

Argument - not emotional, based on logic and objectivity, achieves an effect. Credibility depends on argument.

Claim - asserts that an idea is true

Justification/reason - clear explanation and logical reasoning that demonstrates how the claim is built from facts

Evidence - Scientific objective data, testing, modeling, etc that helps back up your justification

Claims on spectrum from analytic ("stating obvious") to interpretive ("grasping at the unknowable")

```Claim -> Reason -> Evidence```

A credible statement must have 
* grounds - the basis for your claim, data or facts
* qualifier - use qualifying words to state the certainty of a statement. Don't just assume you're always true. 
* rebuttal - the act of refuting an argument, or a counter claim

Toulmin's Model:

1. Grounds - stabbed body
2. Claim - innocent
3. Reason - We are in class
4. Evidence - sign in sheet
5. Qualifier - someone came late
6. Rebuttal - what if the stabbing happened earlier? - Forsee any rebuttals so you may rebutt them.

Types of rebuttals
* Truth Challenge - claim is not true. requires justification.
* Connection challenge - trickiest type, claim and justification aren't related. Subtlest form of challenge.
* Reason challenge - objecting to use of data as justification. suggests interpretation of data is not reasonable.
* Challenge Accepted - Allowing argument to continue and then undermine the person


Rebuttals have three main parts:
* Claim
* Justification
* Logical relationship between the two

To persuade you may have to tap into someone's convictions, beliefs, or sense of well-being.

Some words have strong emotional impact. (Reusable, children, etc).

Rhetoric - language used to achieve/gain a particular effect

Rhetorical patterns - recognizable ways of arranging information, common structures of thought, things we have learned over time

Inductive Reasoning - start with evidence and assert a claim. Uses specific observable information to derive a probably or theoretical conclusion.

Deductive Reasoning - Asserts a claim and then supports with evidence i.e. claiming Ohm's Law and proving it 

Deductive arguments are shorter, read faster, and are faster absorbed. Inductive leave the reader asking "so what" until the end. Deductive arguments are usually more stable.

# Simple Rhetorical Patterns

* Mechanism descriptions 
  * Explains the structure and shape of an object
  * Visualize

* Process descriptions
  * Step by step how to use something ie instructions

* Escalating/decreasing patterns (list)
  * Arranging items from most important to least important

* Classification and Division
  * Grouping things based on similarities and differences 

* Exemplification 
  * Involves using an example to help explain a concept
  * Replaces evidence sometimes

* Narration 
  * Is a story
  * Records events in a more or less chronological sequence


# Complex Rhetorical Patterns

* Situation-problem-solution-evaluation
  * Describe situation, analyze problem, create solution, evaluate how it works

* Cause-effect
  * It aims to answer particular questions: What if? Why did something happen?
