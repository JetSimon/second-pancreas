# Models for disorders

## Medical Model

* 1800s: Search for physical cause and for curative treatments.
* Mental illness diagnosed on basis of symptoms and treated through therapy
* Credibility gained from recent research in genitically influenced brain abnormalities in brain structure and biochemistry.

## The Biopsychosocial Approach

* General approach positing that biological psychological and social-cultural factors play significant roles in human functioning in the context of disease or illness
* Epigenetics also informs our understanding of disorders

Psychological disorders come from biological influences (how we evolved, our bodies, brains), psychological influences (stress, trauma), and social cultural influences (roles, expectations, definitions of normality/disorder)
