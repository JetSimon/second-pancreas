# The Sexual Response Cycle

Excitement: The genital areas become engorged with blood, causing a woman's clitoris and a man's penis to swell. A woman's vagina expands and secretes lubricant; her breasts and nipples may enlarge.

Plateau: Excitements peaks as breathing, pulse, and blood pressure rates continue to increase

[[Orgasm]]: Muscle contractions appear all over the body and are accompanied by further increases in breathing, pulse, and blood pressure rates.

Resolution: The body gradually returns to its unaroused state as the genital blood vessels release their accumulated blood.
